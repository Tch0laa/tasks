            <h1><strong>Rottweiler</strong></h1>
            <h2>About the Breed</h2>
            <p>The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions.
                A gentle playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie observes the outside world with a self-assured aloofness
                A male Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter.
                The glistening, short black coat with smart rust markings add to the picture of imposing strength.
                A thickly muscled hindquarters powers the Rottie's effortless trotting gait.
                A well-bred and properly raised Rottie will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive.
                The aloof demeanor these world-class guardians present to outsiders belies the playfulness, and downright silliness,
                that endear Rotties to their loved ones. (No one told the Rottie he's not a toy breed,
                so he is liable plop onto your lap for a cuddle.)
                Early training and socialization will harness a Rottie's territorial instincts in a positive way.</p>

                <p>Rottweilers have big brains for those big heads, and their high intelligence means they love to be occupied with tasks  
                    and are wonderful partners in learning. Those who bring home a Rottweiler should be experienced dog owners committed to  
                    providing daily learning opportunities and mental enrichment to ensure a healthy, happy dog. As with all dog breeds,  
                    Rottweilers respond well to consistent positive reinforcement training. 
                    Rotties, like any dogs with a long history of being a working companion, prefer to have something to do. 
                    These are not dogs that will be happy to be left alone all day.</p>
